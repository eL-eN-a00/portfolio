# Statistics - MATLAB Projects

This repository contains MATLAB assignments developed as part of a **Statistics** course.
Each folder corresponds to a practical implementation of statistical estimation and modeling techniques.
All code was written by myself.

## Contents

### 1. Expectation-Maximization Algorithm

**Folder:** 'algorithme_EM'

Implementation of the **Expectation-Maximization (EM)** algorithm for parameter estimation in probabilistic models:
- Iterative estimation under latent variable assumptions
- Maximum Likelihood estimation using EM
- Convergence analysis and parameter updates
- Practical application to mixture models

This project applies estimation theory in situations where direct maximization is not tractable.

### 2. Linear Regression

**Folder:** 'droites_regression'

MATLAB implementations of **linear regression models**, including:
- Least squares estimation
- Maximum Likelihood formulation of regression
- Interpretation of regression parameters
- Evaluation of model fit and residuals

This folder focuses on modeling relationships between variables using statistical estimation techniques.

### 3. Robust Estimation

**Folder:** 'estimation_robuste'

Exploration of **robust statistical estimators** designed to resist outliers:
- Comparison between classical and robust estimators
- Influence of noise and atypical data
- Alternative loss functions and estimation strategies

This work highlights the limitations of standard estimations and the need for robustness in real-world data.
