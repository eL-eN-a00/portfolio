# Welcome to my GitHub portfolio !

Hello! My name is **Elena**, and I am a first-year engineering student at ENSEEIHT, Toulouse, France (equivalent to the third year of higher education - last year of my bachelor)
I am currently specializing in **Computer Science**, and next year I will begin a **double cursus in Artificial Intelligence**.

This GitHub repository gathers all the **major projects I have worked on over the past two years** covering various fields such as Python development, MATLAB data analysis, algorithmics, web development and more. Each folder of this portfolio represents a project completed either for academic purposes, personal learning, team challenges, or internships.

I continuously aim to improve my technical skills, explore new domains, and build meaningful projects with clean, well-structured code.
