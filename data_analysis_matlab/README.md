# Data Analysis in MATLAB - Coursework Portfolio

This repository contains several data analysis programs written in **MATLAB**, developed as part of my coursework in numerical sciences.

Each folders corresponds to a standalone assignment focused on a different statistical or machine-learning method.

All code has been written entirely by myself.

> **Important Notice**
> My university provides MATLAB with specialized academic extensions.
> As a result, some scripts may **not run** on the standard free or trial versions of MATLAB.

## Contents

### 1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
**Folder:** 'analyse_en_composantes_principales'.

This project includes the full PCA procedure, including:
- Centering and standardizing data
- Computing covariance matrices
- Extracting eigenvalues and eigenvectors
- Projecting data onto principal components
- Visualizing variance explained

The goal was to understand dimensionality reduction from first principles without relying on built-in high-level functions.

### 2. Support Vector Machines - Part 1
**Folder:** 'classification_SVM_1'

Implementation of core SVM concepts:
- Separating hyperplane in the linearly separable case
- Maximizing margin
- Understanding geometric interpretation of constraints
- Using MATLAB optimization tools to solve the SVM primal and dual problem

This assignment focuses on the theoretical foundation of SVMs.

---

### 3. Support Vector Machines - Part 2
**Folder:** 'classification_SVM_2'

A continuation of Part 1, addressing more advanced SVM settings:
- Soft-margin SVM for non-separable datasets
- Kernel preprocessing (non-linear feature mappings)
- Visualizing classification boundaries
- Testing and comparing several kernel choices

All decision boundaries are computed explicitly through MATLAB code.

---

### 4. Bayesian Classification
**Folder:** 'classification_bayesienne'

MATLAB implementations of several Bayesian decision rules:
- Computing posterior probabilities
- Parametric vs non-parametric density models
- Estimating class-conditional distributions
- Assigning labels using the Bayes optimal rule
- Testing decision boundaries with synthetic datasets

This work emphasizes statistical modeling and classification under uncertainty.

### 5. Parameter Estimation
**Folder:** 'estimation_de_parametres'

A collection of scripts illustrating
- Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
- Method of Moments
- Parameter estimation for Gaussian models
- Comparing estimators and analyzing bias/variance

These are foundational tools used in statistical inference.
