# Imperative Programming in Ada - Coursework Portfolio

This directory contains a collection of Ada programs developed throughought my introductory course in imperative programming.

Each folders corresponds to a small, self-contained assignment focused on core programming concepts such as data structures, modularity, memory management, and algorithmic refinement.

All code was written by myself as part of weekly practical sessions.

## Contents

### 1. Arrays
**Folder:** 'tableaux'

Exercises involving:
- Declaration and manipulation of one-dimensional arrays
- Understanding typed index ranges in Ada

---

### 2. Simple Linked Structures
**Folder:** 'structures_simplement_chaînées'

Implementation of singly linked lists, including:
- Node creation
- Insertion and deletion operations
- Traversal and search

These exercises introduce dynamic structures without relying on built-in containers.

---

### 3. Stacks
**Folder:** 'pile'

A full implementation of a stack Abstract Data Type (ADT):
- Push and pop operations
- Empty/full handling
- Encapsulation using Ada packages and private types

---

### 4. Associative Data Structure
**Folder:** 'structure_donnees_associative'

Implementation and comparison of two associative data structures:
- Binary Search Trees (BST / LCA-style structures) : Construction, insertion, search operations, and traversal of ordered tree-based maps
- Hash Tables : Hash functions, collision handling, and key-value storage using constant-time average-case access.

The objective of this work was to implement both models and then **compare their performance and behaviour** in terms of efficiency, complexity, and practical usage.

---

### 5. Dynamic Memory Allocation
**Folder:** 'allocation_dynamique'

Programs demonstrating:
- Use of access types (pointers)
- Manual allocation with 'new'
- Safe deallocation and memory discipline

This week introduced heap-allocated data and pointer-based manipulation.

---

### 6. Type Constructors and Modular Programming
**Folder:** 'modules_constructeurs_de_types'

Examples showing:
- Definition of custom types
- Package creation
- Encapsulation and abstraction through Ada modules
- Basic use of generics to generalize structures

These exercises reflect Weeks 3-5 of the course (subprograms, modularity, types, and generic constructs).

---

### 7. Small Algorithmic Exercises
**Folder:** 'reviser_tables_multiplication'

A simple program used to practice:
- Loops and conditional structures
- Basic input/output
- Control flow and procedural decomposition

---

## Technologies
- **Ada** (GNAT Compiler)
- GIt/GitLab workflow for weekly assignments
