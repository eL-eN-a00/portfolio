# Probability - MATLAB Projects

This repository contains MATLAB assignments developed as part of a **Probability** course.
Each folder corresponds to a practical application of probabilistic concepts, focusing on modeling, estimation, and statistical decision-making.
All code was written by myself.

> **Important Notice**
> My university provides MATLAB with specialized academic extensions.
> As a result, some scripts may **not run** on the standard free or trial versions of MATLAB.

## Contents

### 1. Correlation and Data Compression

**Folder:** 'correlation_compression'

This project explores the relationship between **correlation** and **data compression** using probabilistic tools:
- Modeling discrete and continuous random variables
- Computing expectations and covariance matrices
- Analyzing correlation structures in datasets
- Studying redundancy reduction through decorrelation

These experiments illustrate how probabilistic properties influence compression efficiency.

### 2. Image Alignment Detection

**Folder:** 'detection_alignements_image'

MATLAB scripts dedicated to detecting linear alignments in images using probabilistic reasoning:
- Modeling pixel intensities as random variables
- Statistical detection of alignments under noise
- Use of correlation and expectation to evaluate alignment likelihood
- Practical application of probability theory to image analysis

This project highlights the use of probability in signal and image processing contexts.

### 3. Maximum Likelihood Estimation

**Folder:** 'maximum_vraisemblance'

Implementation of **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)** methods:
- Parameter estimation for probabilistic models
- Likelihood construction and maximization
- Gaussian modeling and inference
- Extension to random vectors and multivariate cases

This folder directly applies theoretical concepts such as expectations, change of variables, and properties of Gaussian distributions.
